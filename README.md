## Project goals and target audience.  
### Achieved:

-   Creating a website similiar to a social media app where users can create posts and upload images, interact 
and share their joy for custom mechanical keyboards.

### Future projects: 

- Create profile pages where you can see statistics for each user
- Implement a recover password function

## Audience:

- This site is mainly targeted against people who already have an interest in mechanical keyboards, but
can also inspire people to join the hobby.

## Project management

### Github project board, user stories, issues.

- Show your keyboard was developed using an agile method. That includes using githubs issues, user stories and kanban boards.
That let me to an overview with tasks structured in a todo, in progress and done way.
Project board with user stories [Link](https://github.com/users/andreas-ka/projects/5)

- Also used a project with a kanban board for all my bugs during development, they were also categorized to keep track
of critical ones and minor ones.

## Site user goal
Users of Show your Keyboard could have several goals, share and take part of keyboards posts, praise posts with comments and follow content pandering to their interests. Users can also use the site to keep an inventory of their keyboards, meet like minded people and hopefully 
get a friend for life along the way.

## Site owner goal
As a site owner the goal is to provide a stable and enjoyable user experience with a good website design, that also encourages user interaction. Making sure the content is well structured, and easily managed through the admin panel.

## Deployment
Was deployed using Heroku with the following steps:

- Login to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) (Create an account if necessary)
- Click New in the Heroku dashboard and select ”Create new app.”
- Write a name for the app and choose your region and click ”Create App.”
- In the settings tab for the new application, created one Config name PORT and has a value of 8000
- Two build pack scripts were added: Python and Nodejs (in that order)
- Connect your Heroku with your GitHub account and the repository you are working on
- Then at the bottom, you can do a manual deployment or set it to automatic deployment to deploy every time your repo is updated.
