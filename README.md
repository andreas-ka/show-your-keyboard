## Project goals and target audience.  
### Achieved:

-   Creating a website similar to a social media app where users can create posts and upload images, interact 
And share their joy for custom mechanical keyboards.

### Future projects: 

- Create profile pages where you can see statistics for each user
- Implement a recovery password function

## Audience:

- This site is mainly targeted against people who already have an interest in mechanical keyboards, but
It can also inspire people to join the hobby.

## Project management

### Github project board, user stories, issues.

- Show your keyboard was developed using an agile method. That includes using GitHub issues, user stories and kanban boards.
That gave me an overview of tasks structured in a to-do, in-progress and done way.
Project board with user stories [Link](https://github.com/users/andreas-ka/projects/5)

## Site user goal
Users of Show Your Keyboard could have several goals, share and take part in keyboards posts, praise posts with comments and follow content pandering to their interests. Users can also use the site to keep an inventory of their keyboards, meet like minded people and hopefully 
get a friend for life along the way.

## Site owner goal
As a site owner the goal is to provide a stable and enjoyable user experience with a good website design, that also encourages user interaction. Making sure the content is well structured, and easily managed through the admin panel.
